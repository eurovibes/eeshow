Description: Schematics renderer and viewer for KiCad
 Eeshow is a collection of programs that read schematics made by KiCad
 Eeschema and can be used as interactive viewer, or as a command-line
 tool to convert schematics to PNG, PDF, Postscript, EPS, or FIG.
 .
 Eeshow can show the differences between two versions of schematics
 sheets and it can retrieve files directly from a git repository.
 .
 Eeshow was developed as part of the Neo900 project.
